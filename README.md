# Phaser Animation Test

## How to use this 

> A sprite sheet is for loading classic "old school" style animations, where each frame uses the exact same size frame and there is no configuration file.
> 
> This is different to a Texture Atlas, in which the frames are usually variable in size and come with a json or xml file that describes their structure. Sometimes a Texture Atlas is called a "sprite sheet" but that isn't the terminology Phaser uses.  [Load Spritesheet](https://phaser.io/examples/v2/loader/load-spritesheet)
